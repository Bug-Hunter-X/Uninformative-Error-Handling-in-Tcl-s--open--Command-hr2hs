# Uninformative Error Handling in Tcl's "open" Command

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Tcl programming related to file I/O and error handling.  The `open` command in Tcl returns -1 when it fails to open a file, but the specific reason for failure is not readily apparent without additional error checking.

The `bug.tcl` file shows a basic example of how this can lead to cryptic error messages.  The solution, provided in `bugSolution.tcl`, demonstrates improved error handling by using `catch` to capture and display more informative error messages.
